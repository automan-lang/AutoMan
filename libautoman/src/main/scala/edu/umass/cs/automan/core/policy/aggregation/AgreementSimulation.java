/**
 * Goal of simulation: to calculate how many trials are
 * needed to confidently reject the null hypothesis that
 * the most popular outcome is due to random chance.
 *
 * This calculation works as follows:
 * A "simulation" is an experiment where a "choices"-sided die
 * is rolled "trials" times and the number of votes for the
 * most common outcome is recorded.  The entire simulation procedure
 * is repeated "num_simulations" times.
 *
 * Finally, a histogram of simulation outcomes is created
 * and, starting from the smallest number of trials, the
 * probability of random agreement is added to the odds
 * until the probability is >= confidence.  The number
 * of trials needed to reach this point is then returned.
 *
 * Since the number of trials is not known a priori, the
 * expected way to call minToWin is in a loop,
 * where "trials" is incremented until the function does
 * not return -1.
