  There are two versions of the original AutoMan paper, a shortened Research Highlight that appeared in the June 2016 issue of the Communications of the ACM and a longer version that appeared at OOPSLA 2012.  You should probably start with the CACM version which has a bit more polish and some updated results.
  
  The VoxPL paper describes our approach to automate the original wisdom of the crowd task, estimation.  We introduce a novel quality control algorithm and describe how we rebuilt AutoMan's architecture to handle these new kinds of tasks.
